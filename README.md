## Testing

Note: You can create your own account but it will be a normal user, not admin.
Note: Only admin can add events and movies to the database, it will only show buttons for admins.
Note: You need to refresh page because old error feedback on homepage is not removed when you click on login or logout button, but it will be removed when you refresh the page. Its not a problem but for you as a user not to be confused, I just want to let you know about it.

- Here is the account for testing:
  -NORMAL USER ALL INFORMATION:  
  -Name: User  
  -Email: user@test.com
  -Age: 20
  -Password: user123456

-NORMAL USER LOGIN INFORMATION:
-Email: user@test.com

There are some movies and events in the database for testing, but you can also add your own if you are admin. You can check the details of movies and events, but only admin can add movies and events to the database.

There is things that can be improved in the website, but I just want to show you the basic functionalities of the website and how it works. I hope you like it and if you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact us.
